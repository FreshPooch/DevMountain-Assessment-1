    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.

/*
    Create a variable called 'gitHubDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.

    Create a variable called 'gitInitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git init' does.
