// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain





//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = 'This is the second step. Developers discuss what features the project will require, i.e., the kind of data that will need to be tracked or the features that need to be implemented.'
const design = 'The third step where developers discuss the technology they will use, such as databases, frameworks and even language.' 
const implementation = 'The fourth step where developers will physically code out the project based on the design.'
const testingAndIntegration = 'The fifth step, in which the team will make sure the programs work as intended and that they are functional.'
const maintain = 'This is the final step where a project has gone live. Developers will continue to look at the project, develop any features that may help the program run more effectively, catch bugs, and be there if something goes wrong.'
